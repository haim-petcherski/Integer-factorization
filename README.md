"# Integer-factorization" 

Implementing prime factorization with parallel programing. The program gets as an input two files: the first one includes integers and the second one includes the priority order to factorize the integers. In this project two main modules were implemented: Queue and Lock to manage the prioritization of the prime factorization. As well to enable reading and writing correctly in parallel from the files, by the threads that the program creates for each factorization.

**Examples for inputs:**

You can find examples to correct inputs in the Factori directory. Search for the files: tasks and TasksPriorities
